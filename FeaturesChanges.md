### AI Improvement:

- Fusion-AI: When considering whom to attack next, AI-empires that were eligible for the last council-vote will now consider who voted for them. The more votes an empire contributed compared to their own votes, the stronger the effect. The score is affected by: 1 / (1 + theirVotes / myVotes).
  - For example: An empire contributing their 30 votes to an empire who has 50 votes will see their "victim-score" multiplied by: 0.625.
- AI smarter about Blackhole-generator and Stasis-field-usage
  - When a defending fleet has black-hole-generators or stasis-field-generators they will now no longer try to concede the first-hit to cloaked attackers. That is because black-hole-generator success-chance isn't reduced by cloaking-device and stasis-field has 100% chance to succeed.
  - AI-ships equipped with stasis-field-generator will now select targets as if they could kill them in order to make it more likely to freeze the most dangerous stack.
- Update AIGeneral.java
  - When choosing whom to attack next the AI now puts less emphasis on a power-advantage compared to distance and potential gains.
  - Previously AIs would all dog-pile on whoever is weakest, even if this meant a lot of inefficienct flying back and forth. Now they are more likely to take on someone who they can quickly make huge territorial gains against.
- The bombardment-prediction now takes into consideration how many bombard-attacks were performed during tactical-combat and reduces the predicted amount accordingly.
- The AI will no longer interrupt building a colonizer to squeeze out repellant-fighters. Those are nice to have but not crucial enough to delay a colony-ship.
- Improved accuracy of beam weapon fire power estimation.
- Deliberately keeping fleets at uncolonized systems had too much of an opportunity-cost. So it was reverted.
- Bugfixes in retreat-logic
  - Fixed a bug where the AI counted the damage of their own missiles towards the damage they would receive when it came to whether they should retreat from incoming missiles. This caused them to flee from fights they were winning.
  - Range- and speed-advantages no longer arbitrarily impact the combat-outcome calculations of the retreat-logic. This caused faster ships to sometimes not retreat when they should in order to prevent from being killed.
- Value colonizable planets in wars.
  - AI fleets without colony-ships would previously completely ignore all systems without colonies on them.
  - This caused several problems during wars:
    - Uninvolved parties could take over a lot of planets bombed out during a war.
    - Great staging-points for causing further havoc deep in the enemies' empire were given up because they weren't colonized yet.
  - The AI now values uncolonized systems with 1/10th the score of colonized ones for fleets without colony-ship. This will make them stay at such systems and wait for a colony-ship instead of travelling very long distances to another front. The AI will also leave some ships behind on these systems to cover up a colonization while advancing further.
- Avoid premature peace-treaties
  - The Xilmi-AIs will no longer automatically make peace once it's ships can no longer reach colonies of their enemies.
  - Instead the AI will check whether they are currently hovering colonizable systems with their fleets and only consider war when there are none.
- More colony-ships for everyone
  - The AI will no longer be as conservative about building colony-ships once they have the techs needed for going to war.
  - This was meant for them to not overbuild early on but they limited themselves too much later on so someone who would just stay out of conflicts while having a lo of colony-ships could more easily take over everything for themselves.
- Expansion-phase-research-tweeks
  - AI will no longer commit to getting improved environment-techs for systems that are outside of their range.
  - AI will now favor range-techs over engine-techs if they are in the expansion-phase and the range tech is the only way for them to obtain more planets.
- Expansionsts more expansionistic for Character-AI:
  - AIs with the "Expansionist" personality-trait will assume they can get all the uncolonized planets they know about instead of making assumptions about opponents getting some of them too. So they rather risk overbuilding on colonizers instead of putting their resources elsewhere.
- Scout repelling (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue causing the AI not having built Fighters to repel enemy scouts anymore in the early-game for the last 9 months.
- When an attacking fleet can not deal damage to a colony and also won't lose any ships, it will now still retreat as it would have to do so at the turn-limit anyways.
- Fixed several issues that lead to Sakkra- and Bulrathi-AI not Transport-rushing other empires in the early-game when they should
  - Population currently flying around in transports is now considered when evaluating the aggressiveness of Bulrathi- or Sakkra-like empires.
  - Invasions are now considered for all enemy-empires and not only the ones that we are already at war with.
  - For the calculation of an empires' power-level the population that is currently flying around in transports is now taken into consideration too.
- Speed-requirement for missiles in ship-designs reduced
  - When considering whether to use missiles for their ship-designs the AI now has a lower speed-requirement for the missiles based on the enemie's designs speeds.
  - The distance-advantage of repulsors is split above the two turns the missile will travel instead being considered twice.
  - It is also taken into consideration that the missile only needs to get into 0.7 range instead of having to catch up to the target's center.


### Governor:

25-05-23 (BR)
- Auto-Scouts improvement:
  - To avoid damaging our relations with empires we are not at war with, Auto-Scouts will leave their colonies to go to the most strategic location.
- Auto-Scouts will leave alien colonies, even if they don't have new star systems to explore. This is to avoid damaging your relationship with that empire.
- New option to automatically label a design with colonization capabilities as "Auto Colonize".
- New option to automatically label a small or medium hull design with extended range capabilities as "Auto Scout".
- New governor option to update spendings after spy allocation is increased.
- New option to delay spy training when in contact with an empire. This is to avoid any changes to spending allocations.
- Added an option for armed auto-colonizer to guard or not their colonies. (If tagged as Attack, they will always guard.)
- Improved Governor Contextual help for Auto-Scout Auto-Colonize and Auto-Attack.
- New option "Less zealous scouts" to prevent our auto sent scouts from constantly crossing our space from one end to the other, scouts already deployed will have a more limited range of action. Later, if a scout is closer to a star already targeted, it will also be directed towards this star in order to discover it as quickly as possible. (This last feature can be disabled independently)
- Fixed armed auto scout protecting planet instead of scouting.
- New auto-attack option to select relation level of target empires.

  - New option to set a minimal growth, as the natural growth can be very low once the planet is almost full.
  - New option to force "Develop colonies as quickly as possible" until the colony has reached a minimum industrial level. (This way you can predefine the production when colonizing a rich planet... and production will not be started too early)
  - Similarly, new option to define when missile bases should be built. By default, they are only built after all factories are built... But in case of war, or a neighbor who is a bit too nosy, it may be interesting to build them earlier.
- New governor "advanced options":
  - to disable the "Pop/Factory ROI limit" after the empire has grown pas a limit. (Sending transport is then more efficient.)
  - to display production in green when "Pop/Factory ROI limit" has been reached.

### To categorize:

2024.12.16 (BR)
- Eco growth is now displayed with one decimal.
- Obedient Governor improvement:
  - Will follow the request "Develop colonies as quickly as possible".
  - Eco growth is no more rounded, for a more precise adjustment.
  - Mandatory growth while bellow 50% filled.
  - Keep a minimal growth of 2pop/years.
  - New prioritization sequence:
    - Defense if more than minimal base, and defense is tagged.
    - Ship if build ship limit is given.
    - Terraform, grow and update the colony factories.
    - Tagged fields.
    - Defenses and research.
- New option to block governor from sending transport from a colony.
  - Ctrl-Click on "Send Transports" Button.
- Added Missing Tundra tech Flag
- New Square grid available with alt-W

2024.12.12 (BR)
- French translation improvement.
- Added new sub panels for galaxy setup.
- Governor actions will update the technology icons on the left side.
- Wider central space on two column option panels.
- Improved automatic connection of lines on help panels.

2024.12.09 (BR)
- Fixed Rallied fleet not always being sent.

2024.12.08 (BR)
- Added missing headers in the Options Panels.
- Added new sub panels for galaxy setup.
- New Options Panels are now the standard panels.

2024.12.07 (BR)
- By default, Rallied Fleet will now join the combat. And the option is saved in "Remnant.cfg"
- New Governor option: "Follow Colony Request"... This will put in place sort of an obedient junior governor. He'll first respond to your request, then do his best to minimize micromanagement, like his big brother... If a "Ship Build Limit" is set, it will be built first. If you lock ship allocations: He won't change them. He'll also follow the priority indicated in blue (Ctrl-Click on the text on the left).
- Fixed occasional null destination Id after fight with transit rally alone.
- Resize long text in compact menu.
- The option Rally combat loss is now saved in "Remnant.cfg"

2024.12.06 (Xilmi)
- Colony Ships in wars
  - Reverted a previous change that prevented the AI from building colony-ships when it had fewer military than their enemies.
  - Rationale: While those colony ships seem like a waste of resources, the wars are not so much about direct fights anyways. What is important is being able to reach the enemies' colonies. So a small but constant flow of colonizers can be necessary to get access deeper into the enemies' territory.

    - Last.options for the last GUI settings. Saved when you exit a setup panel.
    - Game.options for the last played game settings. Saved when a game is started or loaded.
    - User.options for your preffered settings. Saved Panel-by-panel on-demand.
  - On the Main menu, Control-key will give access to load all options from a file.
  - Global Mod options are also accessible thru Control-key. There you can configure how options are loaded at launch and after a game was played: By default it's set as "Vanilla" and you won't see any changes.
    - Vanilla Launch = Race, Galaxy, and Advanced options Panels are set to "Defaults" and mods panels are set to "Last".
    - Vanilla After game =  Race, Galaxy, and Advanced options Panels are set to "Game" and mods panels are set to "last".
      - Choosing "Last", "Game", or "User" will set all panels to "Last", "Game", or "User".
  - Custom races can now be saved and reloaded. You can give them a name and description which will be displayed on the races panel when "Custom Races" is enabled.
  - The Available race files are displayed on the right and can be loaded by clicking on them. The one on the top of the list is the last race selected.
  - Selecting a race on the left list no longer loads them, it selects it as the base race, defining their relationship. To load them use, Ctrl-Click.
  - On the race diplomatic panel, the show race abilities will also display the AI that controls them (Top right)
  - Restart has been redone to manage new races and new options saving. While restarting, you can:

2022.10.19 (BR)
  - Fixed Randomized alien races not reaching target values.

2022.10.14 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue where the report of how many transports were destroyed it would show the number of transports that the defending fleet potentially could have destroyed instead of the actual number.
  - Fixed an issue whith Autoplay being enacted at the start of the game before the views were updated which led to not taking distances into consideration.
  - When sending a colony-ship to unexplored systems the AI will now double the value of yellow stars and multiply the value of orange and red stars by 1.5.
  - AI will no longer send scouts to systems it has already send a colony-ship to.
  - AI will be more efficient with its scouts by giving a higher priority to targets closer to existing scouts.
  - When loading a save-game there's now a validity check for fleets that eliminates fleets with negative amounts of ships. This is a work-around for an issue reported by /u/Thor1noak. Unfortunately the cause of of the underlying bug could not be determined from the save-game.

2022.10.08 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a bug that caused scatter-pack-missiles doing way less damage than expected during orbital-bombardment. Preview was correct already but actual execution wasn't!
  - Fixed a crash that could occur when autoresolving combats that included missile-bases.
  - During combat AI stacks will now avoid triggering automatic reactive fire of enemy stacks with higher initiative when they can outrange them.
  - During combat target selection of AI will now double the preference of attacking an enemy stack, when it should be able to kill at least one ship in the stack.

2022.10.06 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue that prevented you from switching off ship-building when the governor was enabled on planets that were captured while building ships. Thanks again to /u/Mjoelnir77 for reporting.

2022.10.04 (Xilmi)
  - Halfed the numner of systems for the biggest possible map-size. I wanted to do more trial&error to see what the biggest is that I could go but I couldn't be bothered to sit another several minutes through galaxy-creation-time.
  - Fixed polish translation of Deuterium Fuel Cells to be the same as the translation of Iridium Fuel Cells.
  - Colonies now always produce at least 0.1 income in order to prevent weird effects resulting from zero or negative income. This fixes an exploit reported by /u/Mjoelnir77

2022.10.03 (Xilmi)
  - Reduced the amount of animation-frames for shooting weapons and displaying weapon-effects when using auto-combat to speed it up significantly.
  - Reduced the amount of animation-frames for bio-weapons to the same number as for regular bombs.
  - The expansion-tab on the systems-screen now also provides information on fertility, mineral-richness and artifacts.
  - The exploit-tab on the systems-screen now also provides information on planet-type and size.
  - In autoplay-mode the personality and objective of your AI's leader is now visible in the diplomacy-tab of the races-screen.
  - Fixed that "Hybrid" was missing from the autoplay-options.
  - The order of "Fun" and "Character" in the menu have been swapped to indicate that "Character" is likely the easier of both options.
  - "Character" is the new default-AI-mode for now as I want to gather more feedback on it's changes and I think this increases the chance of people using that mode.
  - Fusion-AI will now ask others if they would start a joint war on their preferred target even if they are not already at war with their preferred target.
  - Fusion-AI will now agree to starting a joint war, if someone asks them to attack their preferred target together even if they wouldn't have done so on their own.
  - The AI-Mode "Character" has been reworked tremendously. The personality and objective of each leader should now have significant impact on how they behave.
    This impacts tech-slider-allocation-preferences, the choice who, if anyone is preferred as war target and how likely a war-declaration on their target is.
    Each objective type prefers a certain tech-category in the way, that they act as if all techs in that category cost only half of the regular price.
    Technologist => Computers, Industrialist => Construction, Diplomat => Force-Fields, Ecologist => Planetology, Expansionist => Propulsion, Militarist => Weapons
    Choice of favorite war-target now works as follows:
    Militarist => Their military-industrial-complex needs to justify itself and infuences the decisions of their leader. And the best justification is to have a strong enemy. They will always pick the opponent with the strongest military.
    Industrialist => Protecting their existing industry takes precedent over anything else. They will pick whoever is the owner of the colony that is closest to their core-worlds.
    Ecologist => Their main-interest is to keep the ecology of the galaxy as balanced as possible. They want to regulate species that have grown out of control and will always target whoever has the highest population. If that is themselves, they see no reason for war and will not attack anyone as war is not particularly great for the eco-systems of the planets either.
    Technologist => They want the techs. All of them. If you have techs, that they don't have you move onto their target-list. The higher the levels of these techs the higher you move up on their "to take techs from by force"-list. If they have everything everyone else has, they are completely content and won't attack anyone.
    Expansionist => They want more planets. Regardless of how many they already have. They want them quick and they don't want to make this goal hard for themselves. They attack in a similar pattern as the Industrialist. Except they look at what planet is closest to their core-fleet and they also take into account how much resistance they expect from their target.
    Diplomat => They are the most cunning of the bunch. They use a complex algorithm that takes a lot of things into account. In particular what the relationship of other races with each other looks like. They are very likely to pick on the ones who are already struggling.
    Personality impacts whether and when wars are declared and whether and when peace is considered. They impact the behavior as follows:
    Important note: None of the following is true, when there's only 2 factions left. In this case, all of them will always immediately attack.
    Ruthless => They will definitely attack their preferred target and chase it down until there's nothing left to attack. They don't care about their own losses and will only ever agree to peace when they are very close to extinction.
    Aggressive => They will attack even if they are at somewhat of a disadvantage. But they are not suicidal. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Xenophobic => They are cautious and opportunistic. They only attack when they see themselves at an advantage. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Erratic => On average they are just like the Xenophobes... But sometimes they are as aggressive as an aggressive one... other times they are quite timid and skittish. But the average is of little help, when they still declare war eventually. They will make peace if things are looking badly or when they are eying another target.
    Pacifist => They are actually real pacifists and don't want to have anyhting to do with war. They never start wars on their own. They will want to make peace as soon as the situation has changes. Regardless in what direction. Even if they are winning. Except when they still have transports en-route, that is!
    Honorable => They won't start a war unless someone asks them too. If they are asked to attack the target they are eyeing, they will declare war. They won't do surprise-attacks and always warn their target in advance. However, once they have commited to a war, they will not back down from it. There is no honour in backing down!
    Note, that the competitive strength of these personalities varies dramatically as I deliberately chose not to care about balancing them at all. All that was important to me for this AI-type is to make them play their roles in an immersive way!
    So while a Xenophobic Diplomat will naturally make smart decisions suitable for winning, whereas a Honorable Militarist might let themselves be dragged into a war with an opponent that will eventually just kill them.

2022.09.30 (Xilmi)
  - Shooting beam-weapons should now look much more like how it looked in Master of Orion.

2022.09.28 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a bug reported by /u/Thor1Noak where the robotics-control-bonus of the Meklonar was not being taken into consideration for calculating how many alien factories could be converted within one turn and thus lead to neither building nor converting any factories at all.

2022.09.27 (Xilmi)
  - AI follows a more adaptive research-strategy in the expansion phase.
  - Fixed an issue where in certain cases the AI accidentally knew whether a system was colonized or not when it shouldn't be able to know it.
  - Fixed an issue where the governor wouldn't realize that planets became colonizable after the event that turns uncolonizable planets into colonizable ones.
  - Reworked diplomatic decision-making of Fusion-AI. It should be a lot more aggressive and also try to stop empires that are getting too strong.

2022.09.21 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a crash reportet by /u/Thor1Noak that could occur when the AI wanted to check the range of their current colonizer during diplomatic negotiations, while only having a huge colonizer-design but now no longer wanting a huge design for colonizers but hasn't had the chance to design a new non-huge colony-ship yet because diplomacy is processed before ship-designing!
  - Changed e-mail-address for the bug-report-prompt to my own.

2022.09.20 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a rare issue that could cause the governor to forget it was supposed to be building ships.
  - Fixed that the bombardment-preview would display too high of a kill-count when the attack-level exceeded 10.
  - AI no longer tries to reinvade rebelling colonies when they are under siege by their enemies.
  - AI now uses actual travel-turns for the scoring of where to send their ships. Previously this was extrapolated by distance:speed with a modifier for nebulae. This change likely will increase AI-processing-time on big maps but should help the AI to make better decisions when nebulae are involved.

2022.09.18 (Xilmi)
  - Removed AI: Unfair and added two new AI's instead: AI: Fun and AI: Character. The diplomatic behaviour of AI: Fusion has also been reworked.
  - AI: Fusion: While the race still has some impact on aggression-level, it is now significantly less aggressive for all races and more about playing safe.
  - AI: Character is roughly similar to how Fusion-AI used to work a while back and takes leader-personality into account for how aggressive it should be. Pick this option for getting the experience clostest to how it played before this update.
  - AI: Fun is meant to provide a fun challenge with comparable difficulty across different playthroughs rather than having extreme variance from one game to another. I don't want to spoil yet how exactly it works as I want some unbiased feedback. But I promise that it neither cheats nor is aware of the player to do so. This is now also the default for new games.
  - Random-options for AI have been changed accordingly. Instead of "Random" and "Random+" there now are:
  - AI: Random - Chooses a random AI out of all other AIs.
  - AI: R.Basic - Randomly chooses one of Base, Modnar or Rookie.
  - AI: R.Xilmi - Randomly chooses one of Roleplay, Hybrid, Fun, Character or Fusion.
  - AI: R.no relat - Randomly chooses on of the AIs that don't use relationship for decision-making, which are: Fun, Character and Fusion.
  - The impact of tech-level to both the power-graph and AI's consideration of other's power is now linked to how miniaturization works. This means getting new techs in early-game will have a much lower impact on the power-graph.
  - Fixed an issue that didn't take how far the mouse's scrolling wheel was spun into consideration of how far to scroll in load-game-screen. This issue exists at many places throughout the game that all need fixing. But fixing it for loading-screen was most important due to how much of a nuisance it was to scroll down to a turn-1 save if you have a lot of auto-saves.
  - Fixed that altering build-limit would only call governor when altered from colonies-screen.
  - Fixed governor overspending in ecology under certain circumstances.
  - AI now takes initiative into account when considering whether a speed-disadvantge will lead to dealing less damage.
  - Fixed an issue that prevented AI from attacking the Orion-guardian.

2022.09.13 (Xilmi)
  - Changed that after finishing a predefined amount of ships or a stargate the allocations weren't changed back automatically from ships to something else.
  - When you change the build-limit the governor is called and will immediately start building the ordered ships given it doesn't need all of it's allocation to build something else.
  - Having a build-limit set now will also tell the governor that it's colony is supposed to be building ships. In this case it doesn't need a tick in ship-allocation to remember that.
  - Governor will now spend the exact amount of money required into building the ships requested via build-limit instead of keeping the bar at a maximum.
  - Fixed an issue with tech-tree-generation when "Always" was chosen in "MOD Options B" for certain techs that could cause the available techs to be empty for certain tiers and thus made the category unresearchable.
  - When the opponent has a warp-dissipator, AI will not try to retreat their last ship at the last moment anymore and instead at the first moment it thinks it'll lose.
  - AI now will want to upgrade trade-treaties when the trade-volume is more than 1.5 than that of the last treaty or the treaty is maxed out instead of requiring both of these conditions to be met.

2022.09.12 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed issue introduced in last version that prevented the governor from building defensive structures.

2022.09.11 (Xilmi)
  - The player is now informed when a stargate is finished even if it was built using governor.
  - When the governor is active and the player is informed about being able to change allocations the part that readjused allocations on it's own differently from how the governor would have behaved is no longer executed.
  - The "Equalize Allocations"-button in the Tech-screen now uses a more equal algorithm for it's equalization.
  - Instead of using a cost-based fleet-power analysis the AI now uses one based on firepower and defensive stats. This should lead to more accurate assumptions about whether a fleet will be able to deal with their enemies. This will help the Fiershan and Altairi in particular as their bonuses are now correctly taken into consideration during this analyis.
  - Ship-design-screen and Military-tab in the race-screen now include racial-bonuses for attack and defense for the displayed ship-design-stats.
  - Fixed many bugs in AI-fleet behavior. Most of those caused by the revamp of using a fleet-power-based analysis but certainly also some that existed before. Keep an eye open for remaining unintentional behaviors, though!
  - Fixed issue causing AI not attacking space-monsters like the Guardian in space-combat.
  - Fixed issue where finishing a research-category would not automatically redistribute the allocation-points that were freed up by this.
  - Fixed issue that prevent you from using the governor to build ships in the same turn a stargate got finished.
  - Fixed a nested call of the governor that could lead to weird, unintentional slider-allocations.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead to not putting remaining allocation into either ships or research.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that caused it to put an additional click into ship-building instead of only when it was meant to memorize that it was building ships before. This sometimes could lead to pollution.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead it to put more allocation into ecology, industry or ship than was needed to finish the current project.
  - Fixed an issue in the governor that could lead to allocating more production than it actually had available when building a stargate.
  - Fixed that you could change the allocation of the eco-slider when it was locked by using the max-slider-button.
  - Fixed that after maxing the eco-slider the function that makes sure that it's clean was called as that could lead to the slider not actually being maxed.
  - Fixed that when using the max-slider-buttons from inside of the Colonies-screen the sliders wouldn't properly update.

2022.09.09 (BR)
  - Moved restart button to the left side, to be visible in windowed mode too.

2022.09.09 (Xilmi)
  - The bombardment-prompt now includes an estimate of how many factories will be destroyed.
  - AI no longer assumes that producing population to man all already existing factories is always worth it. Instead the return of investment of workers working factories is compared to the savings of letting population grow naturally.
  - AI cost-benefit-analysis for invasions now takes lost-productivity into account on the cost-side and how many factories will likely be destroyed until the invasion arrives on the benefit-side.

2022.09.08 (BR)
  - Fixed restart issue for late game when an empire as lost his home world.

2022.09.06 (BR)

2022.09.05 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed width-issue in races-screen and replaced short text describing racial abilities with a more prominent hint to click the text to get full information about a species' abilities.
  - Autodesign as well as AI now try to fill up the design better when there's still some space left.
  - Some refactoring considering the Roleplay-AI. Roleplay-AI now uses the same AI-General as Fusion-AI. This shall bring some lacking aspects of it's play to Fusion-AI's level. All important distinctions are in it's AI-Diplomat.

2022.09.04 (Xilmi)
  - Introduced new AI-type: Hybrid. Hybrid-AI is based on Fusion-AI but uses the same Diplomacy- and Espionage-logic as Rookie-AI.
  - Planets initially spawned as fertile were lacking the associated size-increase. This is fixed now.
  - Fixed that confirming a design after using Auto would change the icon of the design.
  - Fixed that Incidents meant exclusively for the Roleplay-AI were also taken into consideration by other AI-types.
  - Fusion-AI will now retreat from enemy colonies it can't do damage to even if their fleet would survive aswell. This is to prevent useless losses if one stack has auto-repair but the colony would target another other.

2022.09.03 (BR)
  - Restart: Fixed nearby system order; Not important to the player, but the AI was fooled.
  - Restart: Fixed Swapped opponent randomly generated.

2022.09.02 (BR)
  - Restart: You can now choose the empire.
  - Custom Races Menu: Fixed ground attack cost.
  - Custom Races Menu: Swapped colors.
  - Fixed some Aliens races badly set.

2022.09.01 (BR)
  - Addition of the Xilmi help file in pdf format, on each release, alongside the jar files.
  - Fixed Show abilities.

2022.09.01 (Xilmi)
  - Both trade-partners now gain faster trade-route-growth if one of them has a diplomacy-bonus.
  - Auto-ship-design now recognizes the role of the previous design in that slot and will create a design fulfilling that same role.
  - Fixed an issue that caused AI being able to research Future-Tech before it had all other techs in the respective category.
  - Fusion-AI less willing to resort to designs with almost no bombs when fighting multi-frontier-wars.
  - Removed a condition that could lead to Fusion-AI not to build colony-ships.
  - A bunch of improvements of how Fusion-AI reacts to their opponents building many missile-bases.

2022.08.31 (BR)
  - Diplomacy panel: Added show all abilities by clicking on "Ability".
  - Removed the values of the planet type.

2022.08.30 (BR)
  - Added Target Range for race customization.
  - Alien Races can be set to copy the player race.
  - Fixed Ocean and Jungle not being set.
  - Ranamed CustomRace to CustomRaceFactory to match the naming philosophy.

2022.08.28 (Xilmi)
  - The growth-speed of trade routes has been normalized and is no longer affected by how much one empire likes the other.
  - The racial diplomacy-bonus now impacts trade-route-growth-speed.
  - Removed an unintentional way of Fusion-AI rejecting peace-treaties.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI considered bio-weapons to always do no damage when there was at least one missile base on the strategical map. This makes them way stronger in mid-game-bio-weapon-elimination-wars.
  - Fixed an issue where the AI would always try and sometimes fail to find an alternative target for a fleet too small take on an enemy siege-fleet. This issue was especially problematic when they were outranged. And this fix should make the AI much better at defending.
  - During war AI will only use their own colonies as gatherpoints.

2022.08.27 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue causing Modnar- and Rookie-AI to be replaced by Roleplay-AI.
  - The starting ship-designs for Fighter, Bomber and Destroyer are now procedurally generated to make sure they work correctly with Neo-Humans and custom-races that change the space on their ships.
  - There now is an Auto-button on the ship-design-screen that will automatically generate a design for the selected size.
  - Fixed an issue that could cause missile-boats to be designed with sizes that weren't intended for missile-boats.
  - Further improved invasion-logic of Fusion-AI.
  - Fusion-AI will now adapt the usage of shields depending on how many of the systems they can reach are in nebulae.
  - Fusion-AI now uses a more optimistic logic to determine whether its fleets should be able to handle enemy missile-bases during decision-making where to send their fleets.
  - Fusion-AI will no longer retreat defending ships when they are the last stack other than their planet and the missile-bases would beat the opponent all alone.
  - Fusion-AI will no longer consider personality to determine how aggressive it should be. However, there is now a bigger variance in how the race impacts aggressivness. This also means the extremes of extremely aggressive and extremely passive have been removed and everyone is within a range of 67-150% of the default. Note that for now all custom-races played by the AI will use default-aggressivenes instead of something appropriate to their modifiers.

2022.08.27 (BR)
  - Adjusted Race Customization setting cost.
  - Changed the randomizetion limits with Min, Max and Smooth Edges

  - Added personal github building tools allowing easier release Notes.

2022.08.23 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed a bug that would break tech-trees when using the "Always" option for techs in the "MOD Options B"-menu.

2022.08.21 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue that could cause AI to bomb when it shouldn't and not bomb when it should.
  - The amount of ships that cover for an incoming invasion of an enemy planet will be reduced in some cases.
  - You can now create rally-points by right-clicking a system while having another system selected. This will also shift all rallies going towards the selected system to the right-clicked system. This is a fast and convenient way to quickly reorganize rally-points.

2022.08.17 (Xilmi)
  - The scout-fix from yesterdays version could cause AI to spam lots of colony-ships. This has been fixed.

2022.08.16 (Xilmi)
  - You can now review each races' ability in the diplomacy-tab in the races-screen
  - AI will now continue to use already existing scout-designs when it doesn't want scouts anymore rather than having them idle until they are scrapped (primarily impacts NeoHumans)
  - When the AI designs ships where the primary weapon is 2-shot-missiles it will not use shields or defensive specials at the same time in favor of more fire-power

2022.08.15 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue where AI would consider potential enemy missile-bases as more dangerous than they actually are during invasion-calculations

2022.08.14 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue where AI would continue to build huge colony-ships when it shouldn't
  - Improved selection of systems where Fusion-AI builds colony-ships to allow faster expansion
  - Fusion-AI will now avoid attacking undefended planets in tactical-combat when it would destroy a colony it still wants to invade
  - Fixed issue where Fusion-AI would sometimes bombard planets it shouldn't bombard
  - Fusion-AI invasion-logic is now completely driven by cost-benefit analysis including the troops expected to be shot down
  - Fusion-AI no longer refitting factories when there's an urgent threat like an invasion or a siege

2022.08.09 (BR)
  - Technology Always/Never: Never affect Artifacts Planets Too.
  - Technology Always/Never: Removed Terraform120 as it's already Always, and selecting Never crash the game!

2022.08.09 (BR)

2022.08.08 (Xilmi)
  - Hostily from Advanced Options now impacts Fusion-AI
  - Added "Smart-Resolve" (like Auto-Resolve but allowed to retreat) to the ship-combat-prompt-options

2022.08.07 (Xilmi)
  - Fixed issues with AI tech-selection
  - AI will not focus on computer techs before it has the techs it needs for a rush
  - Fixed an issue present in both governor and AI that would send more people from rich and fewer people from poor systems than intended
  - Fixed an issue where AI started building too many military-ships too early in the game

2022.08.07 (BR)
  - Removed every calls to Java 9 and Java 11. Now only Java 8.
  - Initial Profiles.cfg generation: removed call to the updated "Always Stargates"

2022.08.06 (BR)
  - Removed the useless double call to options() and newOptions().
  - Rewrote "Restart with a new race". It's now a "Start" allowing to load an old save and copy galaxy and opponents.

2022.08.04 (BR)
  - Made tools to simplify setting addition to user preferences: Only two lines are needed.
  - Made tools to simplify setting addition to MOD Options GUI: Only two lines are needed (Using above tools). Compatible with traditionnal settings.
