# Remnants of the Precursors

## To-Do list

### Bug to fix:

- Check phantom empires, when still alive without colony, but with transports.


### Very soon:

- More Spy AI choice to sabotage the same planet.
- Add option to limit random event tech generosity... (For slow research, etc...)
- Adapt Modnar's species.
  - early-gamers could be called the Peak or Peakers
  - Jack-trades maybe Traders or Jackals
  - New Star System names
  - New pictures
- Is there any way of setting up alliances before the game, so you could e.g. have two teams of three ?
  - Starting alliances (free for the ai to dismiss)
  - Starting factions (Stronger than alliance, but breakable at very low diplomacy level)
  - Immuable faction (Like final war)

- Search tools for options.


### Later:

- Declare war and ask join war the same turn:
  - Swap the messages
  - Option to remove "Ask join war"
- Some Achievements options.
- Monsters:
  - More Planet Monsters Guardian.
- Add a temerity setting to custom species.
- Color List for opponents...
- Some kind of positive monster like instead of attacking strong empires it defends weak empires
- Stronger GNN filters
- Stronger Warning filters
  - Check what recall diplomat limitations are.
- Species Easy-Normal-Hard
- Tech trading extended list.
  - Switch tech level category...
- Governor: Individual disable receive troops
  - The AI is bombing my world, killing 7 or so colonists per turn. Every turn, my healthy planets send colonists to 'help', which ALL get killed by the orbiting enemy fleet. I would like to be able to prevent this while still allowing transport between my other planets.
- Are there any plans to give the player an option whether to drop Death Spores or not, when they are present? (Or to only use Death Spores, and not bombs)?
- A way to prioritize automatic colonization would be nice.
  - Weight "nearest my borders" vs "best planet"
    - if i'm trying to expand rapidly, that size 30 poor at the edge of my fuel range might be more valuable than a size 60 abundant in my core 
  - 3rd colonization weight for "flight time" would be useful as well.  if I've got 2 worlds building ships and 2 worlds to colonize, the first ship built might fly to the planet over by the 2nd shipbuilding world.
  - Colonize closest.
