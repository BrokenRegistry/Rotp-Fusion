### Windows OS

#### Using .zip file

You don't need to install Java.
- Unzip to a folder outside of "program files" (It could be ~/Games/ROTP)
- Double click on the .exe file.

#### Using .jar file

- Make sure you have at least Java 17 installed.
  - You can download easy to install Java here: [temurin23](https://github.com/adoptium/temurin23-binaries/releases/latest) and get OpenJDK23U-jre_x64_windows_hotspot_"last version".msi
- Download the .jar file to a folder outside of "program files" (It could be ~/Games/ROTP)
- Double click on the .jar file.


### Linux OS

- Use the package management to install the latest Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
- Download ROTP-Fusion and stick in in a directory. It could be ~/Games/ROTP
- Bring up a terminal
- CD to the ROTP directory
- Start the program with something like: java -jar rotp-Fusion-2024-06-07.jar
- Some Linux OS are memory stingy and need to be told to not hog memory.
  - java -Xmx4096m -jar rotp-Fusion-2024-06-07.jar arg1
  - The dummy argument "arg1" tells ROTP to just assume everything is fine and start with whatever memory is allocated.


### Mac OS

- Mac OS are based on Linux OS
- Applications/games/rotp/ is a good place to run it smoothly!
