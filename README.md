## What's New

25-10-06 (BR)
- In the Species Customization pane, you can now select where the species Files are stored.
  - They can be organized in sub-folders, and will be displayed with their sub-folders.
  - The file Name (on the left) is used as key, and will be updated to include the sub-folders. This to avoid two species having the same key.
- An introduction text file can be added to the same directory as the species, with the same file name and the extension “.intro.txt.”
  - It will be displayed when you start a new game with this species.
