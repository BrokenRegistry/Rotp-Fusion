## What's New

25-10-01 (BR)
- Fixed combat against guardian monster. In case of draw, the empire will now retreat.
- Some sub-options, which depend on other options for their values to be taken into account, are displayed semi-transparently when their values are not taken into account.

25-09-30 (BR)
- Fixed potential crash when undeploying fleets.
- Clarification of the retreat options, naming and guide description.

25-09-29 (BR)
- New pom.xml version management.
- Fixed a bug that allowed a guarded planet to be colonized.
- A victory against the Orion Guardian will now grant you the relationship bonus you are entitled to.
- When you colonize Orion, the AIs will not complain about your expansion. (However, if you colonize other planets during the same turn, they will complain.)
- The number of votes required to win will remain displayed during the council and will turn green if there is a winner.
- Fixed a bug that prevented pirate loot from being collected as announced!
  - This occurred when the "Monsters gives loot" option was set to "No." However, since the original pirates have default loot, it will now be awarded to you.
