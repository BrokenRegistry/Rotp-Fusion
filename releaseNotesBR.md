- Changed the default mouse sensitivity to "High" to prevent annoyingly slow UI responsiveness.

26-01-15 (BR)
- Fixed numerous "getGraphics()" calls that did not properly call "dispose()".
  - Many of them were used intensively.
  - This should lighten the load for the garbage collector and, hopefully, prevent "insufficient memory" screens from appearing.
