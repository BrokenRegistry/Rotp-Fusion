- Added "Symbiosis" to the "Warmongering" level list. This allows you to form an alliance on first contact. (Quite bland... Will be improved)
- Moved two hard-coded texts to the label files to make them available for translation.
- Fixed the number of alien factories being hidden under the sent population.
- In colony multi-selection, "G" no longer toggles governors individually; they are now all synchronized to the displayed value.
- Fixed the issue where the opponent's AI guide was not displaying relevant information.
- Fixed Random generator throwing error when asked for a number between 0 and 0; will return 0 instead.
