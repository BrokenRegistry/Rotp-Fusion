- Added "Symbiosis" to the "Warmongering" level list. This allows you to form an alliance on first contact. (Quite bland... Will be improved)
- Moved two hard-coded texts to the label files to make them available for translation.
- Fixed the number of alien factories being hidden under the sent population.
- In colony multi-selection, "G" no longer toggles governors individually; they are now all synchronized to the displayed value.
