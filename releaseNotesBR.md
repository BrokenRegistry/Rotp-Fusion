<b><ins>Very last changes:</ins></b>

- Fixed Bitmap Galaxy "Guide" text, that was too wide to be displayed.
- Improved the appearance of Tech bubbles.
- The "fine tuning" options are now available from the "original" governor panel.
- Improved "Obedient Governor" response to "Develop colonies as quickly as possible".
  - For planets and species with reduced growth, there is an option to boost natural growth to match normal growth.
  - New option to set a minimal growth, as the natural growth can be very low once the planet is almost full.
  - New option to force "Develop colonies as quickly as possible" until the colony has reached a minimum industrial level. (This way you can predefine the production when colonizing a rich planet... and production will not be started too early)
  - Similarly, new option to define when missile bases should be built. By default, they are only built after all factories are built... But in case of war, or a neighbor who is a bit too nosy, it may be interesting to build them earlier.
- "Colonies Building:" values will now also be updated after a new "Default Design" is told to swap shipyard production.
- Extended "Default Design" feature: New default will be applied to shipyards if "Shift" is down.
- Fixed a rare crash occurring when a flight path is changed while it is displayed.
- Fixed Rally not always rallying.
