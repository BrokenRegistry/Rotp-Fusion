<b><ins>Very last changes:</ins></b>

26-02-01 (BR)
- When an error occurs, an error report file is now created.
  - Sometimes the error is so buried in Java calls that no Rotp code lines appear on the screen, making screenshots useless. These lines will appear in the new report file.

26-01-30 (BR)
- Fixed DNA workshop guide location in windows mode.
- New interface for customizing species, and renamed to DNA workshop.
- Fixed asteroids no longer disappeared gradually.
- Updated JRE in the .exe file to Version 25.0.1_8

26-01-23 (BR)
- Changed the default mouse sensitivity to "High" to prevent annoyingly slow UI responsiveness.

26-01-15 (BR)
- Fixed numerous "getGraphics()" calls that did not properly call "dispose()".
  - Many of them were used intensively.
  - This should lighten the load for the garbage collector and, hopefully, prevent "insufficient memory" screens from appearing.
