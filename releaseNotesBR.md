New Java requirement: minimum JRE-17, recommended JRE-23.

Info for Mac Users: Applications/games/rotp/ is a good place to run it smoothly!


<b><ins>Very last changes:</ins></b>

- Fixed Ufo tracker showing the wrong destination when retreating.
- The Dark galaxy apply to AI too.
- Fixed Dark Galaxy sabotage preselecting a dark system.
- Error Messages and Warning Messages will now display the OS.
- Moved Dark galaxy option to "Galaxy Rules"
- Scout repelling (Xilmi)
  - Fixed an issue causing the AI not having built Fighters to repel enemy scouts anymore in the early-game for the last 9 months.
- Expansionsts more expansionistic for Character-AI: (Xilmi)
  - AIs with the "Expansionist" personality-trait will assume they can get all the uncolonized planets they know about instead of making assumptions about opponents getting some of them too. So they rather risk overbuilding on colonizers instead of putting their resources elsewhere.
- Expansion-phase-research-tweeks (Xilmi)
  - AI will no longer commit to getting improved environment-techs for systems that are outside of their range.
  - AI will now favor range-techs over engine-techs if they are in the expansion-phase and the range tech is the only way for them to obtain more planets.
- Moved "French" selection to second position, as English and French are the only fully supported language of RotP-Fusion.
- New option "Less zealous scouts" to prevent our auto sent scouts from constantly crossing our space from one end to the other, scouts already deployed will have a more limited range of action. Later, if a scout is closer to a star already targeted, it will also be directed towards this star in order to discover it as quickly as possible. (This last feature can be disabled independently)

- Moved to java 17
