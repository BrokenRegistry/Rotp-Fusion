- Fusion-AI: When considering whom to attack next, AI-empires that were eligible for the last council-vote will now consider who voted for them. The more votes an empire contributed compared to their own votes, the stronger the effect. The score is affected by: 1 / (1 + theirVotes / myVotes).
  - For example: An empire contributing their 30 votes to an empire who has 50 votes will see their "victim-score" multiplied by: 0.625.
